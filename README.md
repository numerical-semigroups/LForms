# LForms
An example on how to display Lshapes of numerical semigroups

The notebook [LForms](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/LForms/blob/main/Lforms.ipynb) shows two different methods. The first one based on the `tikz` [template](https://texample.net/tikz/examples/plane-partition/) by Jang Soo Kim, which is the one used in the paper [On the number of L-shapes in embedding dimension four numerical semigroups](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X15001922). The second method provives a `svg` approach.
